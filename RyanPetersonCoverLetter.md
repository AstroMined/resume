**Dear SRE Hiring Team,**

I'm excited to apply for the Site Reliability Engineer position here at ScienceLogic. While my five years in technical support have given me deep expertise in our platform and customer needs, I'm eager to channel my passion for automation and system reliability into an SRE role where I can have broader impact on our infrastructure and customer experience.

**Why I'm Ready for This Transition:**

Throughout my tenure at ScienceLogic, I've naturally gravitated toward SRE-aligned work. My focus on root cause analysis has evolved from simply resolving tickets to systematically identifying patterns that prevent future incidents. My automation projects demonstrate my drive to eliminate friction and scale solutions. For example, I created a large-scale automation tool that validates customer vulnerability reports and streamlines research on patch status, turning what was hours of manual work into an automated process.

My personal projects reflect this same mindset. Building Debtonator taught me the importance of comprehensive testing (94% coverage) and API design. Creating the PyGithub MCP Server required implementing production considerations like rate limiting and modular architecture. These aren't just side projects; they're how I think about reliable, scalable systems.

**What I Bring to the SRE Team:**

- **Deep Product Knowledge**: Close to 4 years supporting SL1 gives me unique insight into how our customers use and break our platform
- **Production Mindset**: Regular on-call rotations have honed my incident response skills and ability to think clearly under pressure
- **Customer Empathy**: My 4.8 CSAT rating reflects not just technical solutions but understanding the business impact of outages
- **Continuous Learning**: Recent DevOps certifications and personal projects show my commitment to staying current with SRE practices

I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to shift from reactive support to proactive reliability engineering, building the monitoring, automation, and processes that can help prevent some of the very issues I've spent years resolving.

I look forward to discussing how my unique perspective as someone who deeply understands both our product and our customers' pain points can contribute to ScienceLogic's reliability goals.

**Thank you,**  
Ryan Peterson
